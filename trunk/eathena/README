This is just eAthena. We store our scripts, item and monster databases, etc.
in a separate git repository called tmw-eathena-data, available at:

 http://gitorious.org/projects/tmw-eathena-data

Note that this repository contains more than just the contents of this data
directory. Either set up symbolic links or just copy the server executables
into it.
